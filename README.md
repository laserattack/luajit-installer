# ðŸŒ‘ LuaJIT installer

`win/luajit_install.vbs` - installer for win 10+

## Windows 10+

Change the `archive_url` in the installer to a link with the current version of LuaJIT (or leave it that way if version 2.1 suits you)

```VB
' settings block start

archive_url = "https://github.com/LuaJIT/LuaJIT/archive/refs/tags/v2.1.ROLLING.zip"

' settings block end
```
